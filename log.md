# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: 31 December, 2020

**Today's Progress**: Hosted a WP (Woocommerce) site on a live server (Linux/cPanel)

**Thoughts:** Understanding MySQL privileges on a shared hosting server was bit of a challenge but made through it. With this committ, I set on my #100DaysOfCode journey that will mainly revolve around eCommerce projects as well as Python and Machine Learning learnings.

**Link(s) to work**: The project is localhost only for now, but planning to host it here soon.

### Day 1: 01 January, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Started exploring and working on payment gateway integration for Woocommerce (localhost).

**Thoughts**: The payment gateway integration process looks challenging but with large number of resources available, I hope to get it done in some time.

### Day 2: 02 January, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Started exploring and working on payment gateway integration for Woocommerce (localhost).

**Thoughts**: The payment gateway integration process looks challenging but with large number of resources available, I hope to get it done in some time.

### Day 3: 03 January, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Learned about and worked on Wocommerce payment APIs for Google Pay and Paytm (contd.).

**Thoughts**: The integration really seems complicated since it's my first time, but I am confident of getting this done soon. Also, apart from this Woocommerce project, starting learning Python for Data Science on FCC.


### Day 4: 04 January, 2021
**Today's Progress**: Officially kicking off Python for Data Science on FCC today. Devotted 2 hours today learning the fundamental concepts of Python.

**Thoughts**: It feels great to refresh Python and I am excited about what's to come next :)
